# Chapter 3: Beginning exploration

Now we begin the journey of building a Sails theater seating app that
will act as the primary example app we build upon in the rest of this
book. In the end the app will have users, #! what else? 
However, we will begin with the creation of static pages.

Although Sails is designed for creating database-backed real-time APIs
as part of a [service oriented architecture 
(SOA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), it
also can be used to make static pages with some dynamic content. We'll
cover this in this chapter. As well we'll also go over a bit of
automated testing, which allows us to confidently make changes to
existing code, knowing that that changes we make won't break existing
functionality.
