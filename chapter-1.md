# Chapter 1: Hit the ground running

## Setting up your environment
As I stated in the introduction setting up your development environment is something that makes even veteran developers squirm. Rather than explore how to setup a development environment, especially for those on Windows, I've opted to give you options that will work out of the box. However I recommend you at least attempt to setup your own environment in the future, upon completion of this tutorial. 

1. Register for [Cloud9](http://c9.io) or [Nitrous.io](http://nitrous.io). Both of these services offer free plans.
2. Setup a Node.js environment. This is the language Sails.js is written in. Either of these services will come stock with Node.js, NPM, and git. 
3. Install sails using the following command:

    $ npm install sails -g

## Crash course in the command line
Regardless of your background, the Unix command line is likely something you're not familiar with. If you're using one of the recommended services you'll have a Unix command line [shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) setup with [Bash[(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and available in the bottom of the screen.

The command line is conceptually simple. By issuing short commands, users can perform a large number of action, such as creating directories (mkdir), moving and copying files (mv and cp), and navigating the filesystem by changing directories (cd). The command line may seem primitive to users mainly familiar with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), however, the command line is one of the most powerful tools in the developerâ€™s toolbox.

The command line is a complex topic that deserves a tutorial of it's own, but for this book we will need only a few of the most common Unix commands, listed in Table 1.1. For a more information about the Unix command line, see [Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/) by Mark Bates (available as a [free online version](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book) and as [ebooks and screencasts](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/#pricing)).

###### Table 1.1
Description | Command | Example
----------- | ------- | -------
list contents | ls | # ls -l
make directory | mkdir <dirname> | mkdir myStuff
change directory | cd <dirname> | cd myStuff
cd up one | | cd ..
cd home | | cd ~
cd path to incl. home dir | | cd ~/mystuff/
move file (rename) | mv <source> <target> | mv README.txt README.md
copy file | cp <source> <target> | cp README.txt README.md
remove file | rm <file> | rm README.txt
remove empty directory | rmdir <directory> | rmdir myStuff
remove non-empty directory | rm -rf <directory> | rm -rf ./myStuff
concatenate & display file contents | cat <file> | cat README.md

## Your first app
Now we create your first Sails.js app using the command line. 

    $ sails new helloWorld
    info: Created a new Sails app `example`!

#! do you need to npm install at this point to sails lift?

    $ cd helloWorld

You can now see the home page of the app you've created by entering

    $ sails lift

and going to `http://localhost:1337`.

## Sails file structure
Notice how many files and directories the `sails new` command creates. This standardized file structure is one of the many advantages of Sails. You immediately get a basic functional app, and because the file structure is the same between all Sails apps you can immediately understand where you are when dealing with someone else's code, and makes working with a team much easier, as you don't have to guess at where someone else would have put a particular file or function.

    helloWorld/
      -- config/
      -- views/
      -- api/
        -- models/
        -- controllers/
        -- policies/
        -- responses/
        -- services/
      -- tasks/
      -- assets/
        -- images/
        -- js/
        -- styles/
      README.md
      .gitignore
      package.json
      .sailsrc
      app.js
      Gruntfile.js

## NPM & Package.json
The [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.org/) (NPM) is a package manager for Node.js. It runs through the `package.json` file and installs the necessary dependencies, while ensuring that all the needs of the dependencies are met.

Unless you specify a version number next to the package NPM will automatically install the latest version of the package published to the NPM registry.

There is also a way to specify versions of a package that include only minor or patching changes. `~1.0.0` for example will install any package up to, but not including `~1.1.0`.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC)
This early on it may be a bit difficult to understand, but it's good to get a high level view of the way Sails works. You may have noticed the standard Sails file structure includes an `api/` folder which contains a `models/` and `controllers/` as well as a separate folder for views. This should tip you off to the fact that Sails follows the [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller) pattern. This is used to separate "business logic" (the part of the program that determines how data is created, and used) from the input your application receives and what is shown to the user. In most web development "business logic" usually includes things like users or products. Sails has specifically designed to keep this separation high by being designed to build APIs for the consumption by other apps that serve as the view. For the sake of simplicity however, we will assume that our Sails app includes views within the app. 

When you interact with a Sails app your browser sends a request to a web server and passed to the Sails controller which dictates what happens next. Sometimes this will mean that a view is rendered immediately. This view is converted to HMTL and sent to the browser. Usually the controller interacts with a model which represents an object such as a user, as well as communicating with the database. At that point the data is sent back to the browser to be rendered in HTML.

## Hello world!
In this first example we'll make a very small change to the app, add a controller action to render the string "hello world!", rather than the default Sails.js homepage.

Controller actions are defined in controllers, as you can gather from their name. We'll call this action `hello` and place it in a brand new controller that we'll create, because as you'll notice, we don't currently have any controllers. You can verify that yourself by running this command:

    $ ls api/controllers/

which will allow you to see a list of the current controllers. This action uses the `res.render` function which we'll discuss more in a chapter 2.

###### Adding a HelloController and `hello` action.
`api/controllers/HelloController.js`
```node
module.exports = {
  hello: function(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello world!");
  }
};
```

In order to you'll also need to modify the routes in order to set this new action to your home page. To do this we'll need to edit Sails' router. The router sits in front of the controllers, and determines which controllers to send requests to. We want to change the root route, which determines what is displayed at the root URL. (It's called the root URL because it's the URL for a website which contains nothing after the first forward slash. For example http://example.com/ would be a root URL.)

`config/routes.js`
```node
.
.
.
module.exports.routes = {
.
.
.
 '/': 'HelloController.hello' 
.
.
.
};
```

You can now test your changes by running `$ sails lift` again, and going to `http://localhost:1337`

## Version control with Git
Now that we have the a working Sails app we're going to put our code under version control. For this particular app it may be overkill, but when you're dealing with an app of any complexity or importance you'll want to put your code under version control. Version control is used to track changes in the code, collaborate, and roll back to reverse any unintentional errors created as you are creating new features, or deleting old files. Version control is an essential skill for every developer.

The most commonly used version control system is [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Git is another large, complex topic. If you'd like to dive deeper into Git check out the free book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

Git comes installed on either of the cloud services, and most Unix operating systems, but if you need to install Git [go here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Setting up Git
Before we get going with Git it's important to set it up. Because these are system setups you only need to do them once per computer.

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email yourEmail@example.com
    $ git config --global push.default matching
    $ git config --global alias.co checkout

The name and email address you specify in your global Git config will be included in any repositories you make public. The first two are the only ones required for this tutorial. The third line ensures forward-compatibility, and the fourth line is simply for convenience, allowing you to use the command `git checkout` with `git co`. 

### New repos
When starting a new project you'll need to create a new repository (repo for short). Navigate to the root of the new project and intialize the new repo using the following commands:

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/helloWorld/.git/

Next we're going to add all of the files to the repo using 

    $ git add -A

This adds all files in the current directory, barring those that match patterns included in the `.gitignore` file, which specifies files you don't want to be included in teh repo. The `sails new` command automatically generates a `.gitignore` file with sane defaults for a Sails project, but you can add new ones if you'd like.

When you add files they're first placed in a staging area, that has all of your pending code changes. You can check which files are in the staging area using the `git status` command.

```
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

  new file:   .editorconfig
  new file:   .gitignore
  new file:   .sailsrc
  new file:   Gruntfile.js
  new file:   README.md
  .
  .
  .
```

In order to keep the changes that you just made you can use the `commit` command, as shown below:

```
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 7a21161] Initial commit
.
.
.
```

The `-m` flag allows you to add a message to your commit on the command line with your commit, otherwise your system's default editor will be opened up and you will be prompted to enter your commit message there. Note that commit messages are used to tell your future self and others what exactly you did. As such more descriptive commit messages are always preferable to generic ones like "fixed bug".

Note that when you make a commit it is only recorded on your computer until you utilize the push command. This is called storing the commits (changes) locally. We'll go over using a remote reposistory (one not on your local machine) later.

You can see a list of all previous commit messages using the Git `log` command.

```
$ git log
commit 7a21161777161e42ad5e255e2e72c8f9217330ed
Author: Britton Broderick <britton.jb@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 17 08:59:32 2014 -0700

    Initial commit
```

If your repo's log is long enough to require scrolling to see all of it you have to type `q` to exit the log.

### So... why Git?
Right now it's probably still not exactly clear why you should use Git if you haven't used it before. To illustrate exactly why let's go through two different scenarios, one a bit of an extreme example. Suppose you're building your app and accidentally delete the controllers directory.

    $ rm -rf api/controllers/

Using the `rm -rf` command tells the system that you would like to remove the following files and directories and the `-rf` flag tells you to remove each file and directory under the targeted folder without asking for confirmation.

We're able to see the the damage done using the `git status` command:

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  deleted:    api/controllers/.gitkeep
  deleted:    api/controllers/HelloController.js

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can now see that these flies have been deleted, but currently they are on the "working tree" because the changes haven't been commited yet.

Without Git you would be panicking at this point, and crying distraught tears because you just wiped out all of the work you (and your team) have been doing. This is where Git saves the day. You can now undo these changes using the `checkout` command with the force flag `-f`.

```
$ git checkout -f
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

You can verify this undid the damage by running the command:

    $ ls api/

And seeing the files and directories are back where they belong.

### Github & Bitbucket
Now that we're using Git, we need to push our code to remote repo. To do this wee need to setup a remote Git repo. To do this we recommend using either Github or Bitbucket, which are the two most popular services for remote Git repos.

The differences between these two services are small, but significant. Github allows for unlimited free public repos, but Bitbucket allows for unlimited private repos, with a limited number of contributors. As well as both having differences in the UI.

In practice if you're building an app for commercial purposes I'd recommend using Bitbucket, but if you're building an open source project, or attempting to build a portfolio of apps I would recommend using Github.

The reason for using one of these services is two-fold. First it allows you to have a backup of your code, so if you lose all the data on your hard drive you won't lose your whole project. Also, it makes it much easier to work with a team.

Getting started with either of these services is easy.

1. Sign up for an account.
2. Copy your [public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), as show below.

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3. Add your public key to your account by going into your account settings and then the **SSH KEY** section.
4. Create a new repo called helloApp.
5. Add the remote repo, and push to the remote repo.

```
$ git remote add origin git@<service domain>:<username>/helloApp.git
$ git push -u origin --all
```

The command `push -u origin -all` tells Git to send all of the changes you've commited to your local repo to the remote repo called `origin` which in this case represents Github or Bitbucket. The `--all` option tells Git to send all of the *branches* that you've commited. We'll go over branches later in the book.

Of course, you shoudl have replaced <username> and <service domain> with your username and the domain of the service you're using. For example I could run either of the following:

```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:britton-jb/helloApp.git
$ git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:brittonjb/helloApp.git
```

### Git workflow
In this section we'll make some changes to the README to showcase the preferred Git workflow style.

Branching is a key part of the Git workflow. It allows us to make a copy of the repo we're working on where we can make the changes we need without changing the primary code base. Most of the time the *master* branch is the primary branch, from which we can create a new topic specific branch to deal with a new bug, feature, or simple experiment using the checkout command and the `-b` flag.

```
$ git checkout -b update-README
Switched to a new branch 'update-README'
$ git branch
  master
* update-README
```

In the above example the `branch` command lists all of the local branches and the asterisk lets you know which branch you're on at the moment. The `git checkout -b update-README` command creates a new branch and switches to it.
